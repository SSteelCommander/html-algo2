        <h1>Freedom of the internet</h1>
        <p>You should have a right to privacy in what you do in your own home. Imagine if the government installed a camera inside your room, monitoring internet usage does the same thing.

            Giving power to governments and corporations to regulate the internet gives them power to censor whatever they want, and reduce the freedom of the individual. 
        </p>

            The greater the regulation, the less innovation and spread of ideas. If you had to fill out a long government form, just to host a website or publish some code, less people would do it, restricting the flow of information and new ideas
